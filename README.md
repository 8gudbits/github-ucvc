# GitHub - User Content Version Checker

**A Python module that allows you to check for new releases of any app on GitHub by reading a version file from its repository.**

## Get Started

- To use **`github-ucvc`**, you can either clone the project using **Git**:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/8gudbits/github-ucvc.git
```

- Or simply click **[here](github_ucvc.py)** to download the main file ‚Äú**github_ucvc.py**‚Äù

## Usage

This project allows you to compare versions of your software in three different ways: by release date, by release type, and by release version. You need to create a **`*.ini`** file with a section for version info and upload it to your GitHub repository. Then, you can use the methods from the **`compare_version`** class to compare your current version with the latest release.

- To compare by release date, use the format **`dd-mm-yyyy`** for the date and the **`compare_by_rdate()`** method. For example:

```ini
[version_info]
latest_release_date=03-03-2024
```

```py
from github_ucvc import compare_version as cv

# cv(current_version, version_file_url, section, key, debug)
checker = cv("03-03-2024", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8gudbits/github-ucvc/main/version.ini",
                              "version_info", "latest_release_date", debug=True)

if checker.compare_by_rdate() == 0:
    print("\nINFO: You have the latest version.")
elif checker.compare_by_rdate() == 1:
    print("\nINFO: A newer version is available.")
```

- To compare by release type, use one of the following values: alpha`1`, preview`2`, beta`3`, or release`4` for the type and the **`compare_by_rtype()`** method. For example:

```ini
[version_info]
latest_release_type=preview
```

```py
from github_ucvc import compare_version as cv

# cv(current_version, version_file_url, section, key, debug)
checker = cv("alpha", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8gudbits/github-ucvc/main/version.ini",
                              "version_info", "latest_release_type", debug=True)

if checker.compare_by_rtype() == 0:
    print("\nINFO: You have the latest version.")
elif checker.compare_by_rtype() == 1:
    print("\nINFO: A newer version is available.")
```

- To compare by release version, use the format `MAJOR`**.**`MINOR`**.**`PATCH` for the version and the **`compare_by_version()`** method. For example:

```ini
[version_info]
latest_release_version=1.2.2
```

```py
from github_ucvc import compare_version as cv

# cv(current_version, version_file_url, section, key, debug)
checker = cv("1.2.2", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8gudbits/github-ucvc/main/version.ini",
                              "version_info", "latest_release_type", debug=True)

if checker.compare_by_version() == 0:
    print("\nINFO: You have the latest version.")
elif checker.compare_by_version() == 1:
    print("\nINFO: A newer version is available.")
```

- If your version file is not in **`*.ini`** format, you can use the **`get_version_files_text()`** method to get the file‚Äôs text and process it manually. For example:

```py
from github_ucvc import compare_version as cv

version_file_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8gudbits/github-ucvc/main/version.ini"
content = cv().get_version_files_text(version_file_url)

print(content) # You can now use the text to compare versions manually
```

**NOTE:** You can set the debug argument to false (debug=False) if you don‚Äôt want the code to exit on any error such as, invalid data in version file or invalid url.

### All the return values

```log
0: The current version is up to date.
1: The current version is older than the latest release.
2: Invalid file URL provided or network error.
3: Version file does not contain the section name specified.
4: Invalid date format provided.
5: Invalid version format provided.
6: Invalid current version type provided.
7: Invalid latest version type provided.
```
